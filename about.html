        <p>	<b><span class='first-letter'>J</span>an Švankmajer</b> is a Czech <b>animator</b> and <b>filmmaker</b> born in Prague. An early influence on his later artistic development was a puppet theatre he was given for Christmas as a child. </p>

        <p>He studied at the College of Applied Arts in Prague and later in the <b>Department of Puppetry</b> at the Prague Academy of Performing Arts. He contributed to Emil Radok's film <b>Doktor Faust</b> in 1958 and then began working for Prague's Semafor Theatre where he founded the Theatre of Masks.</p>
    
       <p>He then moved on to the Laterna Magika multimedia theatre, where he renewed his association with Radok. This theatrical experience is reflected in Švankmajer's first film <span class='underline'>The Last Trick</span>, which was released in 1964.</p>
    
        <p>Under the influence of theoretician Vratislav Effenberger, Švankmajer moved from the mannerism of his early work to classic surrealism, first manifested in his film <span class='underline'>The Garden</span> (1968), and joined the Czechoslovak Surrealist Group.</p>

        <p><b><span class="first-letter">H</span></b>e was married to <b>Eva Švankmajerová</b>, an internationally known surrealist painter, ceramicist, and writer until her death in October 2005. Švankmajerová collaborated on several of her husband's movies, including <span class="underline">Alice</span>, <span class="underline">Faust</span>, and <span class="underline">Otesánek</span>. They had two children, Veronika (b. 1963) and Václav (b. 1975, an animator).</p>
        <p>Švankmajer has gained a reputation over several decades for his distinctive use of <b>stop-motion technique</b>, and his ability to make surreal, nightmarish, and yet somehow funny pictures. He continues to make films in Prague.</p>
        <p>Many of his films also include <b>clay objects</b> in stop motion, otherwise known as claymation. Švankmajer's trademarks include very exaggerated sounds, often creating a very strange effect in all eating scenes.</p>
        <p>He often uses fast-motion sequences when people walk or interact. His movies often involve inanimate objects being brought to "life" through stop motion.  Food is a favourite subject and medium. Švankmajer also uses <b>pixilation</b> in many of his films, including <span class="underline">Food</span> (1992) and <span class="underline">Conspirators of Pleasure</span> (1996).</p>

        <h3>Alice (Neco z Alenky)</h3>
        <p class='date'>1988</p>
        <p class='summary'>A dark fantasy film written and directed by Jan Švankmajer. Its original Czech title is Něco z Alenky, which means "Something from Alice". It is a loose adaptation of Lewis Carroll's first Alice book, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), about a girl who follows a white rabbit into a bizarre fantasy land. Alice is played by Kristýna Kohoutová. The film combines live action with stop motion animation, and is distinguished by its dark and uncompromising production design.
